# Outcomes Analysis

## Overview of Project

-	Comparing Outcomes to dates, goals to uncover correlations and trends

### Purpose

-	To see how other campaigns fared compared to Louise’s play in relation to their launch dates and funding goals

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

-	Looking at peaks and troughs for all lines and compare them to dates. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

-	Looking at where there’s most and least success and seeing if there’s a correlation between goal set and the result 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

-	Countifs function. Would try and fit it into 2 criteria when some are easier being split up into 3. Ex. 1000-4999 is easier split into 3 criteria but would try and fit it with in 2 criteria.

## Results

### Theater Outcomes based on Launch Dates

By looking at the results, one conclusion we can make is that theater campaigns are more likely to be successful during the summer months, this is especially true for May as it is the peak with 100 successful campaigns, followed by June, then July. Another conclusion we can make is that October has the most failed theater campaigns, but December is the hardest month to succeed in in terms of percentage with almost half failing.

### Outcomes based on Goals

By looking at the results it’s fair to say that a general rule is: the higher your goal, the more likely to fail. This is shown in the graph as when your goal is less than $1000, your success rate is over 71% (failure rate of 25%). It gets lower and eventually reaches a trough of less than 19% success rate after hitting $50000 or more (with the highest failure rate of 58%. 

### Limitations

One limitation is we didn’t explore how “Fever” compared to the campaigns in its specific region. There’s no analysis on the country that “Fever” is being released in which could paint an overview that’s a lot more specific to our research. 

### Other Graphs/Data

As stated above, it’s probably a good idea to make a pivot table that can filter by country and compare results based on goals, outcomes, launch dates etc.
